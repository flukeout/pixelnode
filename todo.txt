+ fix underpass logic
   + make it so that the first color you see after an underpass determines the valid
   underpass color

+ make the steering input analog
  + that way the touch controllers can give a scale of input
  + make it so that the input basically sends a new value when it's updated, not just
    wether it is on or off in absolute terms. yo.
+ make it so the scaling depends on the viewport and not on a fixed value
  + this will help with stuff
+ gamepad API
+ count down before a race starts?
+ tilt car relative to winner
+ add an indicator for who is leading
+ should we build an array of all the x,y values of the track instead of
sampling pixels?
  + that way - we could add in power ups as well and could check against them.
