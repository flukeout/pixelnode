+ ghosts??
+ inputs? or.... x,y updates?? probably x,yers..........

MULTIPLAYER IDEAS
 + send a lap challange... try to beat this lap time  pixelracer/ad3adb
 + slight decrease in top speed for each lap winner


GHOST MODE

OR RACE MODE <- gotta work on race mode first, we'll need it for Pach's


that way, we can do some predictive shit, we can even try this 2 times a second to see how it feels

+ some kind of weird bug still when you are turning left right in close sucession, try going
left right left right without moving, it kidn of locks up at some point.


+ have the server send the track choice etc.

+ fix underpass logic
   + make it so that the first color you see after an underpass determines the valid
   underpass color

+ make the steering input analog
  + that way the touch controllers can give a scale of input
  + make it so that the input basically sends a new value when it's updated, not just
    wether it is on or off in absolute terms. yo.


+ make it so the scaling depends on the viewport and not on a fixed value
  + this will help with stuff
+ gamepad API
+ count down before a race starts?
+ tilt car relative to winner
+ add an indicator for who is leading
+ should we build an array of all the x,y values of the track instead of
sampling pixels?
  + that way - we could add in power ups as well and could check against them.
