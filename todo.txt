SEND A GHOST
+ Send a lap challange... try to beat this lap time  pixelracer/ad3adb
+ slight decrease in top speed for each lap winner


+ make the steering input analog
  + that way the touch controllers can give a scale of input
  + make it so that the input basically sends a new value when it's updated, not just
    wether it is on or off in absolute terms. yo.


+ make it so the scaling depends on the viewport and not on a fixed value
  + this will help with stuff


+ gamepad API

+ tilt car relative to winner


+ should we build an array of all the x,y values of the track instead of
sampling pixels?
  + that way - we could add in power ups as well and could check against them.
  + true enough, not just pixel values....
