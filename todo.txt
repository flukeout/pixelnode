Better indicator of progress during a game?

 * BOB -----|-----|-----|-----O
 * LUK -----|-----|-----O
 * TIM -----|-----O
 * DIN -----|-----|-----O


IMPROVEMENTS
 * More time after race is over and a player wins......
 * Make it not depend on a 15x scaling?
 * The flex display is messing with the track sizing.. make sure you enforce a minimum and maximum <- (K)


MULTIPLAYER FEATURES
+ add an indicator for who is leading
+ add an indicator for who won the race
+ perfect lap..

TILES
* LAVA (explode and respawn)
* HOLE.. fall through and respawn
 * Both of these need a car history or a checkpoint... I think we can keep a few X,Y coords in a history though..

* unpassable terrain <- I guess that's a ledge already...


MVP
* Add an index page
* Add way to switch tracks in single player
* Add nav along top of modes

=========

SEND A GHOST
+ Send a lap challange... try to beat this lap time  pixelracer/ad3adb
+ slight decrease in top speed for each lap winner

+ make the steering input analog
  + that way the touch controllers can give a scale of input
  + make it so that the input basically sends a new value when it's updated, not just
    wether it is on or off in absolute terms. yo.

+ gamepad API
+ tilt car relative to winner
