Make the finish line the correct colors...

Better indicator of progress during a game?

 * BOB -----|-----|-----|-----O
 * LUK -----|-----|-----O
 * TIM -----|-----O
 * DIN -----|-----|-----O


IMPROVEMENTS
 * More time after race is over and a player wins......
 * Make it not depend on a 15x scaling?
 * The flex display is messing with the track sizing.. make sure you enforce a minimum and maximum <- (K)
 * The fade in thing on track switching suuuucks.... fix it.


BUGS
* Best lap shows one lap after you get it in single player mode, not right away. Should be right away.


TILES
* LAVA (explode and respawn)
* HOLE.. fall through and respawn
 * Both of these need a car history or a checkpoint... I think we can keep a few X,Y coords in a history though..

* unpassable terrain <- I guess that's a ledge already...


MVP
* Add way to switch tracks in single player
