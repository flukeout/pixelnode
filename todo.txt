IMPROVEMENTS
* Make it so you can't fall off the track then respawn in front of the finish and win..
  * Should every track have a checkpoint then?


SINGLE PLAYER TIME TRIAL
* Spawn the player further behind the start line, since it's too close to get a good time

---------

IMPROVEMENTS
 * Fix how the max speed stuff is done - it ain't right.
 * More time after race is over and a player wins......
 * Make it not depend on a 15x scaling?
 * The flex display is messing with the track sizing.. make sure you enforce a minimum and maximum <- (K)

BUGS
* Best lap shows one lap after you get it in single player mode, not right away. Should be right away.

TILES
* LAVA (explode and respawn)
* Bring back water.. sink??

MVP
* Add way to switch tracks in single player

Compression for replays...
One lap of chasm..
 * Recording every frame, with a comma delimited format costs 10.22 KB (this is at 60fps)
 * At 30fps, we can get this down to 5kb, let's say?


========
